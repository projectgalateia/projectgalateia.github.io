![Training Screen of SVM](/static/img/spvis.png)

[SPVIS](https://github.com/projectgalateia/spvis_s) is a tool for visualizing various machine learning algorithms.

After selecting which algorithm to use,
Left clicking on a screen marks the point as Class 1 and right clicking marks Class 2.
Then the algorithm will learn to classify 2D-space.

Currently implemented algorithms are: Linear Classifier, KNN, MLP, NBC(MLE), Perceptron, SVM.

There will be another version with unsupervised learning algorithms in future.
